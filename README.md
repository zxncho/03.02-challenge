# 03.02-challenge
This weeks challenge covers Javascript

## Description
The goal of this assignment was to ensure that the password generator worked correctly according to the instructions.
The issue that was found in the source code was that there was not a function that was called in the beginning of the 
code to ensure that the prompts ran upon clicking the generate button.
